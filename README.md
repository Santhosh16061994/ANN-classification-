# ANN-classification-


ANN classification refers to the process of using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for solving classification problems. ANNs are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, known as neurons, organized in layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and produces an output signal.

In the context of classification, ANNs are trained to learn patterns and relationships in input data and map them to specific output classes. The training process involves presenting the network with a set of labeled examples, known as the training dataset, where each example is associated with a class label. The network adjusts its internal parameters, known as weights, based on the differences between the predicted output and the expected output for each training example. This process is typically performed using optimization algorithms like backpropagation.

Once trained, an ANN can be used to classify new, unseen instances into one of the learned classes. The input features of the new instance are fed into the network, and the output layer produces a probability distribution over the possible classes. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted class for the input instance.

ANN classification has been successfully applied in various domains, including image recognition, natural language processing, spam detection, medical diagnosis, and many others. The effectiveness of ANN classification depends on factors such as the network architecture, the amount and quality of training data, and the choice of activation functions and learning algorithms.
